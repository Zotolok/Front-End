## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries
- Google Fonts (Hanken Grotesk: 500, 700, 800)


### What I learned

This is just a static web page built with HTML and CSS. Though, my major learnings here were the correct implementation (or what I think it is) of Flexbox and CSS Grid to organize the elements in the way I wanted; a better use of the media queries; and I learned a new way to center a div label in the center of a page.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
#### Put div in the center of a page.
```css
.example1{
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center; 
}
```
#### Hover active just if you are not in a mobil device
```css
@media (hover: hover){
  .example2:hover{
    background: black;
    color: white;
  }
}
```


### Continued development

I think this project was a good practice. I enhanced it as much as I could with my current knowledge. So, I think that I just need to review it to fully understand everything I did and used to build the project.


### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me to change the default fonts.
- [Responsinator](http://www.responsinator.com/) - This helped me to see how the page looked like in different devices.
- [Rapidtables](https://www.rapidtables.org/web/tools/window-size.html) -  This helped to know the size of my browser screen while programming.
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) - This web site helped me to upload my static project to the cloud for free.
